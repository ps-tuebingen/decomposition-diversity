## Extracted Haskell Code
The Haskell files in the subdirectory `extracted` should not be modified, since they are automatically extracted from the Coq formalization.

## Build Instructions
In order to keep the Coq formalization and the Haskell code in sync, do not build these files yourself.
Use the `Makefile` in the parent directory.
