# UroboroRepl

## Extracted Haskell Code
The Haskell files in the subdirectory `extracted` should not be modified, since they are automatically extracted from the Coq formalization.

## Build Instructions
In order to keep the Coq formalization and the Haskell code in sync, do not build these files yourself.
Use the `Makefile` in the parent directory.

## Usage
The REPL can be run via `stack exec Repl`
Help is available by typing `:help` inside the REPL.
